#Ada King Problem Code: ADAKING
# Chef Ada is training her calculation skills. She wants to place a king and some obstacles on a chessboard in such a way that the number of distinct cells the king can reach is exactly K.

# Recall that a chessboard has 8 rows (numbered 1 through 8) and 8 columns (numbered 1 through 8); let's denote a cell in row r and column c by (r,c).

# In one move, a king can move to any adjacent cell which shares a side or corner with its current cell and does not contain an obstacle. More formally, a king in a cell (r,c) can move to any cell (rn,cn) if (rn,cn) is a valid cell of the chessboard which does not contain an obstacle and (r−rn)2+(c−cn)2≤2.

# A cell (x,y) can be reached by a king if, after an arbitrary number of moves (including zero), the king is in the cell (x,y).

# Help Ada find any valid configuration of the board such that the king can reach exactly K distinct cells. It is guaranteed that such a configuration always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.

# Input
# The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
# The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer K.
# Output
# For each test case, print 8 lines describing a chessboard, each containing 8 characters. For each valid i and j, the j-th character on the i-th line should be one of the following:

# 'O' if the cell (i,j) initially contains the king; there should be exactly one such cell
# 'X' if the cell (i,j) contains an obstacle
# '.' if the cell (i,j) is empty
# Constraints
# 1≤T≤64
# 1≤K≤64
# Subtasks
# Subtask #1 (10 points): K≤8
# Subtask #2 (90 points): original constraints

# Example Input

# Explanation
# The descriptions of the chessboard for each test case are separated by blank lines for clarity. Note that these lines should not appear on the output of your submission.

# Example case 1: The king is surrounded by obstacles, so it cannot move ― the only cell it can reach is its initial cell.

# Example case 4: The king can visit all cells of the board.
