# What Is This, a Crossover Episode Problem Code: BOJACK
# You are given an integer D. You have to find a string S such that the following conditions are satisfied:

# S is non-empty and its length does not exceed 7⋅D.
# S contains only lowercase English letters.
# The number of distinct substrings in S minus the number of palindromic substrings in S equals D. Here, when counting palindromic substrings, a substring that occurs multiple times should be counted multiple times.
# It can be proved that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

# Notes:

# A string B is a substring of a string A if B can be obtained from A by deleting several (possibly none or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly none or all) characters from the end.
# A palindrome is a string that does not change when it is reversed. E.g. strings "z", "aba" and "dammitimmad" are palindromes, but strings "ab" and "bojack" are not.
# A palindromic substring is a substring which is also a palindrome.
# Input
# The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
# The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer D.
# Output
# For each test case, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain a single integer ― the length of your string S. The second line should contain this string S.

# If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.

# Constraints
# 1≤T≤100
# 1≤D≤104
# the sum of D over all test cases does not exceed 105
# Example Input
# 4
# 4
# 10
# 15
# 60
# Example Output
# 4
# todd
# 5
# diane
# 6
# bojack
# 12
# peanutbutter
# Exaplanation
# Example case 1: There are 9 distinct substrings in S: "t", "o", "d", "to", "od", "dd", "tod", "odd", "todd". Five of them are palindromic: "t", "o", "d", "d", "dd". Therefore, D=9−5=4.

# Notice that while counting palindromic substrings (but not while counting distinct substrings), we are including both occurrences of the substring "d".
